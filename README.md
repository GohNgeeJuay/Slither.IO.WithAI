# Slither.IO.WithAI

Currently Work In Progress

## Introduction
Simplified game based on the online game called Slither.io. 

Its also similar to the classic snake game where the aim is for the snake to get longer by eating an object.
However, there are also other snakes (i.e. players) that have the similar goal. The snakes can try to kill the
other snakes by forcing them to head into a wall or knocking into itself.

## Acknowledgement
The base game logic (for the snake) is based on Clear Code's youtube video, "Learning pygame by creating Snake [python tutorial]".
